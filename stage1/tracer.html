      <h2 class="overhead">STORY</h2>
        <p>Lena Oxton was the youngest recruit Overwatch brought in for their experimental flight program due to her fearless piloting skills. She was handpicked to test the prototype of a teleporting fighter, the Slipstream. Unfortunately, during the test the teleportation matrix malfunctioned and Lena had disappeared, presumably dead.</p>
        <p>Months passed, but eventually Lena had returned with her molecules desynchronized from the flow of time. She became a living ghost and would disappear for hours or days at a time, struggling to maintain a physical form. All hope for Lena was lost until a scientist named Winston designed a chronal accelerator that allowed her to stay anchored to present time. Additionally, it gave her the ability to control her own time and zoom forward in the blink of an eye, or rewind time. This made her a valuable asset to Overwatch and she donned the name of Tracer.</p>
        <p>Following the fall of Overwatch, Tracer remains in the fight for good and helps wherever needed.</p>
