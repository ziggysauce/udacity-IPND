      <h2 class="overhead">STORY</h2>
        <p>In the aftermath of the Omnic Crisis, the Vishkar Corporation made an attempt to rebuild cities that would be self-sustaining. One in particular, Utopaea, had been created with radical hard-light technology that allowed architechs to shape the streets, utilities, and living spaces almost instantaneously.</p>
        <p>Satya was discovered as one of the few who possessed the potential to becoming a light-bending architech and was taken from poverty and placed in the care of Vishkar's academy. Isolated from her family and friends, she immersed herself entirely into her studies and quickly became the top student in the academy. She not only had a knack, but also a different mindset and was able to approach hard-light manipulation differently than any other students.</p>
        <p>Being at the top of the class, Vishkar Corporation saw greater potential even still in Satya's abilities and sent her on missions around the world to uphold their interests and expansion. She became known as "Symmetra" and had expanded the company's influence into many other countries. While she believes her actions and path were for the greater good of the people, she often wonders if the control and order is truly what's best for humanity.</p>
