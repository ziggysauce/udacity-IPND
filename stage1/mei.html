      <h2 class="overhead">STORY</h2>
        <p>As the world's climate began drastically changing, many blamed the new technology and growing omnic populations for the destruction of the planet. The truth however is unknown as to the real reason why the changes were occurring. In order to resolve this issue, Overwatch created a series of eco-Watchpoints at remote locations in the world to detect fluctuations in environmental patterns.</p>
        <p>A well respected climatologist, Mei, was part of a multiyear initiative to be stationed in Antarctica. Unfortunately a disaster occurred and affected a new technology installation of climate manipulation. The aftermath left the scientists with no choice but to enter cryostasis as their rations were dwindling.</p>
        <p>A rescue never came, and it was years until the cryogenics chamber was discovered. Mei became the only survivor. Upon awaking, her world had completely changed. Overwatch ceased to exist, and the negative effects of climate change had gotten worse. Mei decided to begin a solo effort in traveling around the world trying to find out the reason for the world's climate changes.</p>
