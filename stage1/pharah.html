        <p>Growing up, Fareeha dreamed of following in her mother's footsteps and joining Overwatch to help keep peace in the world. She joined the Egyptian Army and quickly rose in the ranks showing success in her skills and intelligence. She became a strong and brave leader, and was a sure-fit for Overwach. However, shortly before she was able to join, Overwatch had ended.</p>
        <p>Following her service in the Army, Fareeha joined the Helix Security International which was a private sector that defended the artificial intelligence research facility in Giza. Upon joining she received extensive training with the Raptora Mark VI, a combat flight suit, and donned the name of Pharah. She continues to fight in hopes of making a difference on a global scale.</p>
