      <h2 class="overhead">STORY</h2>
        <p>Centuries ago the Shimada clan established themselves as assassins with growing power and eventually the creation of a criminal empire that profitted from lucrative trade in arms and illegal substances. Hanzo, the eldest son of the clan leader, was bound by duty to succeed his father and rule the Shimada empire. He was trained intensively in martial arts, swordplay, and bowmanship, all while being prepared for immense responsibilties, leadership and knowledge of strategy and tactics.</p>
        <p>Following the death of the clan's leader, Hanzo was left with the task to ensure his younger brother Genji was on the correct path towards success in helping rule the Shuamada empire. His brother however, was young and reckless, and did not want to take any responsibilities. This lead to family conflict which ultimately put Hanzo in a position to kill his own brother. This crippled Hanzo with guilt and drove him mad, rejecting his father's legacy and abandoning the clan altogether.</p>
        <p>Now Hanzo travels the world, mastering his skills as a warrior, attempting to regain his honor and put the past behind him.</p>
