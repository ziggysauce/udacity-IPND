      <h2 class="overhead">STORY</h2>
        <p>Originally created in order to keep peace and order, the many Bastion robots developed a reconfiguration that allowed themselves to instantly become an an assault-cannon weapon. Despite their original intentions, they turned against their human creators during the Omnic Crisis and became the bulk of the omnics' rebel army. Nearing the end of the crisis, almost all Bastion units were destroyed or disassembled and left their mark as a symbol of horror and conflict.</p>
        <p>Following the resolution of the crisis conflict, one unique Bastion unit managed to survive the final battles of war despite suffering severe damage and left forgetten for over a decade. As it lay dormant in the world, nature slowly reclaimed it as it became practically invisible to the world with vines and roots growing over it and animals perching unaware of its existence. One day, this Bastion unit suddenly reactivated, but had a knack for curiosity in the natural world and its inhabitants. This particular unit took its curiosity and set out to explore the world and discover its purpose.</p>
        <p>While Bastion may appear to be harmless and one with nature, its core combat programming often takes over when it senses danger, utlizing its full arsenal to eradicate any threat presented. Issues have arised as Bastion has encountered conflicting situations with humans which lead to its avoidance of populated areas and instead resorted to uncharted regions of the world.</p>
