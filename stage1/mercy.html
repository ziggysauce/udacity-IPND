      <h2 class="overhead">STORY</h2>
        <p>At a prominent Swiss Hospital, Dr. Ziegler earned her position as head of surgery for her brilliant skills and knowledge of medicinal practices. Soon after, she helped pioneer a scientific breakthrough in nanobiology that drastically improved healing practices. This caught the attention of Overawtch and lead to a recruitment for her skillset.</p>
        <p>Hesitant at first because Overwatch appeared to be a military organization, Ziegler agreed to join despite losing her parents because of war. She saw this as an opportunity to use her skills and save people on a much larger scale than her current position. She became Overwatch's head of medical research and eventually piloted the Valkyrie swift-response suit to tend to required healing in frontline crises.</p>
        <p>Eventually however, Overwatch was no more, but Dr. Ziegler still remained faithful to her practice and continued to help those affected by war.</p>
