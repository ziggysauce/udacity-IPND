      <h2 class="overhead">STORY</h2>
        <p>Genji is the youngest son of the master of the Shimada ninja clan. He lived an excellent life of riches and privilege. Though excellent in his ninja training, Genji had no interests in the family's illegal businesses and preferred to enjoy his time living the playboy lifestyle. Other members of the clan were unhappy with Genji's care-free attitude and feared he would be a liability. They resented his father for coddling and spoiling him. Following the death of the clan's leader, Genji's older brother Hanzo demanded that he become more of an active member in their clan. Genji however refused, infuriating Hanzo, leading to a turmoil of conflict that left Genji at the very brink of death.</p>
        <p>Hanzo believed that he had killed his brother, but little did he know that Genji was picked up by Overwatch and rescued by Dr. Angela Ziegler. The organization saw potential in Genji as a valuable asset to the team to combat the Shimada clan and offered him a cybernetic rebuild in exchange for his help. The process was gruling but ultimately resulted in Genji having enhanced speed and agility as well as augmenting his superlative ninja skills. Genji became a living weapon and took it upon himself to dismantle his family's criminal empire.</p>
        <p>Through each passing day, Genji began to feel more and more at war with himself and eventually became repulsed by his mechanical parts and what he had become. Disgusted with himself, he left Overwatch and became a drifting nomad for several years. He eventually found himself crossing paths with the omnic monk Zenyatta who offered him wisdom and guidance. Zenyatta then became Genji's mentor and taught him how to come to peace with his dual existence as both man and machine. </p>
        <p>Now Genji is at peace with his body that he once rejected, and has discovered a higher humanity. He now sees his cyborg body in the form of a gift with unique strength. He is finally free.</p>
