      <h2 class="overhead">STORY</h2>
        <p>As a member of the Deadlock Gang, Jesse McCree smuggled illegal weapons and military hardware through the American Soutwest for years until his group was busted by an Overwatch operation. Due to his excellent skillset of a sharpshooter and resourcefulness, he was given the opportunity to rot in prison or use his potential and join the covert Blackwatch division of Overwatch.</p>
        <p>Though cynical at first, McCree chose to join Blackwatch in hopes of erasing his past sins of an outlaw. In time, conflict rose within Overwatch as they lost power, leading McCree not wanting anything to do with the infighting. He turned to going underground and becoming a shadow.</p>
        <p>After several years McCree resurfaced as a mercenary for hire, becoming one of the most talented bounty hunters abailable. However, while he is seen as a great commodity to possess on your team, he only accepts contracts of which he believes are for a just cause.</p>
