      <h2 class="overhead">STORY</h2>
        <p>Ana was a founding member of Overwatch who uses biotic weapons to both defeat enemies and heal allies. In her home country of Egypt, the Omnic Crisis became a severe problem and the people heavily relied on elite snipers to defend them. She was recognized as one of the best snipers in the world thanks to her superior marksmanship, quality decision-making, and quick instincts. These traits made it an easy decision to have her lead the Overwatch Strike Team that would eventually end the war.</p>
        <p>With the success of the creation of Overwatch's mission, Ana served as Strike Commander Morrison's second-in-command. Though she had many responsibilites in leading the organization, she refused to sit back from the fight and always put herself into the battlefield. Years after service she was rumored to have been killed during a hostage rescue mission by Widowmaker, a Talon operative.</p>
        <p>In reality, Ana managed to survive the mission with several injuries including the loss of her right eye. She laid low during her recovery and struggled to endure the stress that came from a lifetime of combat. With each passing day however, she realized how much more important it was to help others and refrained from staying in the shadows as people threatened her city and it's innocent people.</p>
        <p>Ana has now rejoined the fight to protect the country she serves and it's people. She fights to keep the opposing forces at bay, but more importantly, to protect her family and closest allies.</p>
