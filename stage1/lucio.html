      <h2 class="overhead">STORY</h2>
        <p>Raised in the poor favelas of Rio de Janeiro, Lúcio suffered his hometown being hit by a financial unheaval following the Omnic Crisis. As Brazil recovered, he sought a way to lift spirits around those who were having trouble with the aftermath. The power of music became Lúcio's main asset as he quickly became a a pretty-well known legend among the streets of Brazil.</p>
        <p>Devastation yet again struck when the multinational Vishkar Corporation solidifed a deal to redevelop large tracts of the city. The people were promised improvement in their lives, but those promises were left unfulfilled. Vishkar instead became an order that controlled the areas with curfews, lawless behavior, and exploitation of cheap labor force.</p>
        <p>Upset by these results, Lúcio stole Vishkar's sonic technology that was originally used to suppress the people, and instead used it to rally them into action. His leadership brought upon the removal of Vishkar and landed him the icon of an international symbol of positive social change. His music became the sound of hope and he became a global celebrity. Lúcio has since strived to make a difference in the world through his music and uplifting social change.</p>
