      <h2 class="overhead">STORY</h2>
        <p>Amélie was the wife of Gérard Lacroix, an Overwatch agent that lead the operations in taking down the terrorist group Talon. Over several attempts to eleminate him, Talon instead took an approach of abducting his wife Amélie. They were able to successfully reprogram her through neural reconditioning which broke her will, suppressed her personality, and eventually turned her into a sleeper agent. She was eventually discovered by Overwatch agents, but two weeks later, killed her husband in his sleep.</p>
        <p>Amélie returned to Talon and finished her transition into a living weapon. She was trained extensively for battle and even went through physiological changes that slowed her heart, turning her cold and blue, and made her an excellent sniper and a ruthless killer with no emotion.</p>
