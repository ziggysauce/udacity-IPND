      <h2 class="overhead">STORY</h2>
        <p>To create a big step in humanity's space exploration, the Horizon Lunar Colony was created. Some of the residents were genetically enhanced gorillas that were intended to test the effects of prolonged life in space. One ape in particular displayed rapid brain development and was taken under the wing of Dr. Harold Winston, who educated the ape in science and told him fascinating tales of human discovery.</p>
        <p>As the young ape grew older, he experienced an uprising from the other gorillas that killed the scientists and claimed the colony for their own. He decided to take on the name of his beloved human caretaker, Winston, and built a makeshift rocket that he used to travel to Earth. Scared and unsure what to do, he was luckily picked up by Overwatch and found a new home. There he saw light in humanity and was able to conduct his own research and become a hero like he always admired in Harold.</p>
        <p>After Overwatch ended, Winston had disappeared to a lab in Gibraltar, cut off from humanity and once again feeling isolated, longing over the days for heroes to return.</p>
