      <h2 class="overhead">STORY</h2>
        <p>Known as a figure in a black robe, Reaper is a terrorist known to cause havoc with intentions unknown. What is know, is that death follows wherever he goes. For decades he has been found fighting in various conflicts showing zero loyalty to any group or organization. Survivors tell tales of a shadowed figure floating through the battlefield, untouched by any attacks.</p>
        <p>Rumors of a speculated genetic alteration failure have come and gone, leaving everyone unprepared for what powers Reaper holds. There is one thing that they have noticed though, he appears to follow a pattern: hunting former Overwach agents. There is speculation that the true identity of Reaper is Gabriel Reyes, a former Overwatch agent and Blackwatch coordinator, with thoughts that he may be behind the fall of Overwatch.</p>
