      <h2 class="overhead">STORY</h2>
        <p>When an Omnic Crisis of robot uprisings began terrorizing the world, Overwatch was founded to counter this threat. As a part of the original Overwatch strike team, Reinhardt was inducted. A highly decorated German solider, he was seen as avaluable asset and strong leader for the team. With the team's success of mitigating conflict, Overwatch became an international institution, keeping peace throughout the nations.</p>
        <p>Reinhardt served as a fearless, bold, and admirable soldier who always had high respect for his peers and held a high code of valor and justice. Into his fifties he was forced to retire from combat operations and become quite sad knowing that his glory days were coming to an end. As time passed, Overwatch slowly began to fade as the organization was beginning to crumble.</p>
        <p>Disheartened by the thought of his family falling apart, Reinhardt decided he couldn't just sit by and watch everything fall apart. He once again donned his crusader armor and vowed to continue his fight for justice. Among various countries in Europe he roams the lands protecting the innocent and promising the people of better days to come.</p>
