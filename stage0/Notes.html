    <h2>Lesson 1</h2>
      <b>Building first web page</b>
      <p>Important to save code as <b>html</b> file in order to work.</p>

      <b>Viewing rendered webpage</b>
      <p>You can find the HTML file on your computer and double click it. Or you can right click and open with... or you can open it directly from the web browser.</p>

      <b>To make changes</b>
      <p>First save changes to the HTML file. Then refresh the webpage.<p>

    <h2>Lesson 4</h2>
      <b>HTML Markup</b>
      <p>The text content is what you see while the markup is how it's arranged. HTML also includes references to other documents (such as images) and links to other pages.</p>

      <b>HTML Tags</b>
      <p>An element makes up an entire tag and in general looks like this: <xmp><tag name>content</tag name></xmp></p>
      <p>To create a bold tag we use: <xmp><b>content</b></xmp>
      To create an emphasis tag (italicized) we use:
      <xmp><em>content</em></xmp></p>

      <b>HTML Attributes</b>
      <p>Tags can have multiple attributes and use the following form:
      <xmp><tag attribute="value">content</tag></xmp>
      Specifically an anchor tag is used for making links:
      <xmp><a></xmp></p>

      <b>Adding Images</b>
      <p>To add an image we use the following code format:
      <xmp><img src="url" alt="text"></xmp>
      Note that an image does not have a closing tag. This is known as a void tag (has no content in the tag).</p>

      <b>Whitespace</b>
      <p>Use either the line break code or the paragraph code to make a new line:
      <xmp><br> or <p></p></xmp>
      Note that the br code is a void tag and doesn't require a closing tag. The difference between these two is that the line break is known to be "inline" while the paragraph is known to be a "block" element.</p>

      <b>Span and Div</b>
      <p>Span is an inline element while div is a block element. Both serve the same purpose and are used to create containers for their content.</p>
