      <h2 class="overhead">STORY</h2>
        <p>After the Omnic Crisis, a small group of outcast omnic robots had experienced a spiritual awakening. They no longer lived their preprogrammed life and instead set out to establish a monastery deep in the Himalayas. Through years of meditation they began to believe that their existence was more than simply artificial intelligence, but rather that they had essense of a soul.</p>
        <p>One monk, Tekhartha Mondatta, led the robots to heal wounds caused by the Omnic Crisis and sought to bring humans and robots into societal harmony. They became widely recognized as people all over the world believed in the message.</p>
        <p>One monk however, did not agree with this direction. Zenyatta, as he was known, felt that the best way to repair the conflict between human and omnic was not through dogmatic teaching but rather through connection and engagement. He felt that a personal relationship would foster a true harmonious balance between the two different beings. He ultimately decided to follow his own path and left the Monastery to wander the world and help those that struggled with internal conflict and personal issues keeping them from finding their inner peace. His true goal is to fight to protect the innocent, regardless of whether they are omnic or human.</p>
