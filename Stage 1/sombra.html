      <h2 class="overhead">STORY</h2>
        <p>At a young age, "Sombra" was one of many children who was left orphaned due to the Omnic Crisis. The country's infrastructure had been destroyed and she only survived by tapping into her potential to hack computers. Later in age, she was inducted into Los Muertos, a gang believed to be rebuilding Mexico against the government's ways that benefited the rich and left the poor with very little help.</p>
        <p>A skilled hacker with mastery in evasion and detection, Sombra eventually found herself tangled in a global conspiracy that compromised her security. She was forced to delete any trace of her existence and went into hiding.</p>
        <p>When she finally re-emerged, she donned the title of Sombra and was determined to discover the truth behind the conspiracy that she had once uncovered. She began a string of hacks across the globe which eventually brought attention to Talon who recruited her. She joined, believing that her contributions would be against corporations with strong affiliations to the government. She was right, and eventually her efforts of a massive cyberattack caused a revolt in Mexico against LumériCo and a security breach of Volskaya Industries.</p>
        <p>Now that Sombra is a part of Talon and has their trust, she can focus on her own personal goal: unraveling the truth behind the conspiracy and instead using its power for her own means.</p>
