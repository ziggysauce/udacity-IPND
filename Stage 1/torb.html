      <h2 class="overhead">STORY</h2>
        <p>A brilliant engineer, Torbjörn was recognized for designing weapons systems used by countries all over the world before the Omnic Crisis. Employers began to believe that weapons should be using networked computer intelligence which he had a quarrel with. He was paranoid of mistrust in sentient robotic intelligence, and his fears became a reality when the robot populations eventually turned on their human creators during the Omnic Crisis.</p>
        <p>He was quickly recruited by Overwatch for his skills and joined the original strike team to fight off the uprising. With his help, Overwatch eventually became known as the international peacekeeping force, and he remained loyal to the organization as the head engineer for technological needs and signature weapons systems.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, following the fall of Overwatch, many of Torbjörn's weapons were stolen or hidden. Torbjörn felt responsible for the creation of powerful weapons that may now be in the hands of corruption and evil. He remains determined to stop them from wreaking havoc upon the innocent.</p>
