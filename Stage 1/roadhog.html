      <h2 class="overhead">STORY</h2>
        <p>Following the Omnic Crisis, the government wanted to establish peace and gifted the Australian omnium and surrounding area to the omnics. This forced Mako and many other Outback residents out of their homes, enraging them for their losses. In response, they formed a violent rebellion called the Australian Liberation Front and attacked the omnium to take back their stolen lands. This continued until eventually the rebellion had destroyed the omnium fusion's core which resulted in the facility being destroyed and irradiating the region.</p>
        <p>Mako saw his home quickly become an apocalyptic wasteland and was never the same. In order to cope he had to wear a mask, and slowly he lost his humanity while gaining essence of a ruthless killer known only as Roadhog.</p>
