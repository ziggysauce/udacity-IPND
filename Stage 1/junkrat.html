      <h2 class="overhead">STORY</h2>
        <p>An attack on Australia's omnium fusion core affected the Outbook in a way that became irradiated with waste and became a harsh, unlivable environment. However, few survived, and they took up the name of the Junkers; a lawless, cutthroat society that thrived in the shadows. One of them, Junkrat, resorted to reclaimed metal for body parts in order to ensure his survival. Driven slightly mad by the radiation, Junkrat became fond of explosives and quickly turned it into an obsession.</p>
        <p>Among the bones of the omnium, Junkrate discovered a secret, which soon brought upon a target on his back. Chased by bounty hunters, gangs, and opporunists, Junkrat made a deal with Roadhog who agreed to serve as his body guard for half the cut of their spoils. With a dynamite duo, Junkrat left behind the Outback and began an international crime spree leaving nothing but destruction and chaos in their path.</p>
