      <h2 class="overhead">STORY</h2>
        <p>Before the Omnic Crisis, OR14s were built as a safety measure of security robots in Nigeria. After the war, they were taken out of commission and did not resurface again until 20 years later when updated OR15s were built to protect the city. After a short period of time following their distribution, Doomfist attacked and destroyed everything.</p>
        <p>In the aftermath of the attack, citizens were left distraught and feared for their lives. The remaining OR15 parts were decommissioned and sold for parts. An eleven-year-old named Efi Oladele purchased some of these parts and decided to take matters into her own hands. A brilliant young girl, she won the Adawe Foundation's 'genius grant' and used her earnings to build Orisa.</p>
        <p>Orisa is a more efficient, updated version of the OR15s but with a personality core that Efi designed herself. Orisa acts as a great service to the city, but is continuing to figure out her optimal protocols. She is beginning her career as a guardian but still has much to learn.</p>
